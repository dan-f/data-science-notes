# Week 1: Introduction to Data Science

## What is Data Science?

Generally the application of statistics and computing to large data sets.

## Why do we have so much data?

Computers! The internet!

## Why do we use visualization?

It makes data intuitive. It's useful both for exploration and analysis.

## What's up with big data?

Big data refers to the explosion in the size of data sets. But one needs to
avoid the myth that the sample size is equal to the population. Sample biases
exist in big data. Machine learning is useful, but if you train a model on
biased data, it will give you biased predictions.
